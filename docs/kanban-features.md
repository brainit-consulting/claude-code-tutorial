### #025 Hosting Options
- **Priority:** low
- **Description:** Free Hosting Options

  1. GitHub Pages (Recommended - Easiest)

  - Cost: Free
  - Pros: Already using GitHub, takes 2 minutes to set up, automatic deploys on push
  - URL: https://brainit-consulting.github.io/claude-code-tutorial/kanban.html
  - Setup: Just enable in repo Settings → Pages

  2. Vercel

  - Cost: Free tier
  - Pros: Fast CDN, custom domains, automatic HTTPS
  - URL: https://your-project.vercel.app
  - Setup: Connect GitHub repo, auto-deploys

  3. Netlify

  - Cost: Free tier
  - Pros: Similar to Vercel, drag-and-drop deploy option
  - URL: https://your-project.netlify.app

  4. Cloudflare Pages

  - Cost: Free tier (generous limits)
  - Pros: Excellent global CDN, unlimited bandwidth
  - URL: https://your-project.pages.dev

  My Recommendation

  GitHub Pages - Since you're already using GitHub, it's the fastest path:
  1. Go to repo Settings → Pages
  2. Select "main" branch as source
  3. Done! Live in ~1 minute

  Would you like me to:
  1. Set up GitHub Pages (simplest - just needs a small config)
  2. Prepare for Vercel (if you want a cleaner URL or custom domain)
  3. Something else?
